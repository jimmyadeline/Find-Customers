# Identify Customer Segments

In this project, I apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.

### Main Steps:

    Load Package and Data
    Data Preprocessing
        Assess Missing Data
        Select and Re-Encode Features
        Overall Cleaning Function
    Feature Transformation
        Apply Feature Scaling
        Perform Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
        Interpret Principal Components
    Clustering (K-means)
        Apply Clustering to General Population
        Apply All Steps to the Customer Data
        Compare Customer Data to Demographics Data
    Conclusion
